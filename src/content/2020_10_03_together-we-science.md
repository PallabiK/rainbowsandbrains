Stories about discoveries and inventions in science are fascinating. Have you heard the story of Issac Newton discovering gravity? Or, Edward Jenner inventing vaccination? Or August Kekulé dreaming of the structure of benzene?

These stories are exciting and inspiring. While these stories focus on one hero scientist who could solve all the problems by themselves, not all of them are true. This can be seen in current popular multimedia (movies/TV shows) as well, where contributions of many people are combined and one lead is presented whom the story follows. For example, in the HBO miniseries Chernobyl, the scientist was Valery Legasov who was helped by 1 or 2 other people. In reality, many scientists were involved in the cleanup efforts after the disaster who were not focused on maintaining dramatic effects.

Now, let’s take a closer look at how the process of science is incorporated in the popular story of how Sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity. There’s no evidence of an apple actually falling on Newton’s head but let’s say it did.

When we follow the process of science, first comes observation. Newton observed an apple fall off a tree. This led him to the question – why did the apple fall off the tree, and a hypothesis that there must be a force pulling the apple to the ground. His prediction was that if everything lands on the ground, there must be a force, which he named gravity (from Latin ‘gravitas’ meaning ‘having weight’) that pulls everything towards Earth. He did calculations and developed his theory of gravity. His calculations led to scientists performing experiments and many studies that showed gravitational force exists between every object in this universe.

It is an excellent story that tells you the power of thinking and discovery. There are many such great stories in science about the discovery and invention that often portrays the ideas of a ‘lone’ genius or ‘accidental’ discovery. Think about our beloved movie ‘Back to the Future’; Doc Brown was able to make a time machine all by himself, without any other scientist in the world knowing. This is unrealistic. What is left out of all these narratives is the collaborative nature of science. In reality, not one person knows everything; not all ideas come to scientists in dreams.

Contributions of other scientists that came before Newton played a role in the ideas Newton worked on. Newton’s theories were built upon work done by Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, and many others who came before him. That is not to say, he was not a genius, but he was not alone. He developed ideas that were already around and provided ideas for his peers and future physicists like Albert Einstein. His work does not exist in isolation.

To get an idea, find any scientific paper on Google Scholar. It can be something random or your subject of interest. First, check out the authors in the beginning. Then, scroll to the last couple of pages of the full paper to the ‘References’ section and scan how many papers are cited. This will give you an idea of how many scientists’ work was followed or used as a reference to do the research for just that paper. It will also help you understand that you do not need to reinvent the wheel whenever you start researching a topic. There have been some, if not a lot, research done in your interest, find it, and build on it.

Scientists not only belong to research universities but they come from industries, government organizations as well as non-government organizations. Once it is realized how collaborative science is, it’s easier to understand why it might seem like science is always changing when faced with new observations. Often, the initial explanations we hear are the 1st hypotheses that some scientists have, but with experimentation and data analysis, that hypothesis might not be supported and then you hear their alternative explanation or alternate hypothesis. There is always emerging knowledge because of how diverse we are as human beings with diverse perspectives.

We need to truly cherish the collaborative nature of science along with the fascinating stories and make science a part of our everyday life and not something beyond it.
