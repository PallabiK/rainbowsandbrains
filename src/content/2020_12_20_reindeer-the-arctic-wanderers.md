Imagine you are stranded at the north pole with just a cart. What else would you wish you had to get to the nearest town? Maybe a helicopter? A snowmobile? Or, if you are of the really adventurous kind, maybe a reindeer. You could have a reindeer pull your cart and make your way to safety. You will be grossly overestimating if you hope the reindeer will fly.

Growing up without the internet, I was not sure if reindeer were real. I had only heard about them in stories related to Santa and the stories made the Rudolphs feel fantastic. I was especially delighted when I found out that reindeer are very much real.

The word ‘reindeer’ originates from the Old Norse word for reindeer which is ‘hreinn’. In North America, they are called ‘caribou’. It comes from the Mi’kmaq word ‘qalipu’ which means ‘snow-shoveller’. It is a very apt name as reindeer shovel snow to eat the plants underneath it.

Reindeer (or caribou), a type of deer, are found in the arctic, sub-artic, tundra, boreal, and mountains of Asia, Europe, and North America. Because they live in a very cold climate, many reindeer migrate to warmer climates in winter. American reindeer can migrate over 1000 km each way. One other land mammal (Gray wolves in Canada- 1016 km) migrates that far. Humpback whales (sea mammals) migrate over 8500 km each way.

Reindeer are deer and are closely related to cows and sheep. They live in herds or groups of 10 animals or more. In summer, they live in smaller groups but in winter and spring, the herds can have anywhere between 50,000 to 500,000 animals. They live for 15 years in the wild and can live as long as 20 years when domesticated.

Reindeer are the only deer in which females also grow antlers. Male reindeer have the second-largest antlers in the deer family, right after moose. Their antlers can be as tall as 135 cm which can be higher than their bodies (~120cm). Reindeer have the largest antler height when compared to body height among deer. Reindeer lose their antlers every year and regrow them in the summer months. The presence of antlers in females is indicative of better health. The calves of antlered-females are often healthier as well. In males, the antlers are used as weapons and are used to dominate other males.

Reindeer have different coat colors, ranging from white to dark brown. The reindeer who live closest to the north pole are smaller and white while the reindeer who live south of the arctic region are bigger and darker. Their furs have 2 parts – a woolly layer underneath a long-haired layer. The long hairs are air-filled and thus provide better insulation for the reindeer to survive the cold. The air-filled hair also helps reindeer swim. They are covered with hair from nose to their hooves. The hair on their hooves provides them with a better grip in snow and ice along with warmth.

The noses of reindeer are specialized. It is important to keep the nose warm and it heats up the surrounding air before it breathes in the air. For this, the nose is supplied with a lot of blood vessels which might give the reindeer’s nose a reddish appearance. Now you know why Rudolph’s nose was red! Reindeer also rely on scent for food, direction, and escaping danger.

Reindeer live in a climate where food is scarce. The main reason why reindeer migrate is in search of food. Reindeer eat lichen (an association of algae or cyanobacteria and fungi) called reindeer lichen, plant leaves, and some fungi. They have to shovel or dig up snow to get to their food. During summer in the arctic, the reindeer synchronize their sleeping pattern with the sun, so that they are awake when the sun is up. This helps them digest their food better. An adult reindeer weighs up to 250 kg can eat 4 to 8 kg of food per day.

Apart from humans who have hunted reindeer for thousands of years for milk, meat, coat, and antlers, reindeer also have other natural predators. Young or baby reindeer can be eaten by eagles or wolverines. Brown bears and polar bears attack weaker members of a herd. Grey wolves and grizzly bears can take down larger reindeer. Different flies can also cause diseases in reindeer.

My favorite reindeer from popular culture is ‘Sven’ from Frozen. Reindeer have been domesticated by humans for thousands of years and are useful for carrying heavy things, transport, and are also used for meat, milk, and fur. They also make great pets.

Reindeer are currently a vulnerable population. With global warming, their habitat is decreasing. One species of reindeer has already gone extinct. Human built structures also interfere with the migration paths of these animals.
