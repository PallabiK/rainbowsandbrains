# Welcome to my third blog post!


All animals either hatch from eggs or are born from their mothers’ bodies. They start from a single cell, make more cells and organs, and also grow bigger. Even after birth, animals grow bigger and make different features to be more adjusted to the world around them. This process is called growth and development. For example, human babies start from a single cell and grow into a fetus before birth. We are born with about 300 bones but as we develop, some of the bones fuse together, and finally, an adult human has 206 bones.

Most animals develop in the environment they are born in. Fish take birth in water and they spend all their lives in water and that environment fulfills all their needs. However, some other animals, mainly insects and amphibians like frogs do not live in the environment they are born in. They undergo a process called metamorphosis.

The term metamorphosis has many figurative meanings but biologically it refers to the drastic changes of shape, structure, and characteristics that certain animals go through during their developmental process. Mainly insects and amphibians undergo metamorphosis but certain fish and marine invertebrates are also known to partake in this process. During the development of these animals, they acquire extreme changes in their habitat, morphology (structure and form), or reproductive stages. It is almost like these animals are shape-shifters! All these changes give them advantages in their adult lives. Before that, let’s look at an example.
