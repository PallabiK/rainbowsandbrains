In school science fairs, we often do fun projects that remain memorable for a lifetime. The hiccups we faced while finishing the project, the fun we had with our friends, and the success/failure of the project are all important learning curves. 

One such project that I was always interested in but never got around to is the potato clock. I had so many questions. Is it a real science experiment or a magic trick? Does it really work? Can it solve the world’s energy crisis? To understand, we will first have to know how electricity works.

Everything is made of tiny parts called atoms. Atoms consist of positive charges or protons and neutral charges or neutrons in its core or nucleus. Outside the nucleus, negative charges or electrons revolve around the nucleus. Electricity is the flow of these negative charges through conductors.

Conductors of electricity are materials that can pass on or lose electrons easily, thus facilitating the movement of electric charges. We have always been taught to not bring water near electronics like toasters as it might electrocute us. The reason is that the water we use is a very good conductor of electricity. Some other examples of good electrical conductors are different metals like copper, gold, etc., impure water (especially seawater), and even concrete.

Things that do not conduct electricity are called insulators. These materials do not contain extra electrons to lose and thus can stop the flow of electric charge. When working with electricity, often we would keep a piece of dry wood nearby to hold in case of electrocution. Plastic, pure water, dry wood, and asphalt are examples of good insulators.

For any electronics to work (light bulbs, watch, phone, etc.), there has to be a closed-loop circuit for the electrons to flow through. One end of the circuit is positive while another end is negative. When using a battery, the positive end is connected to the positive end of an electronic circuit and the negative end is connected to the negative end of the electronic circuit. This creates a closed-loop where electrons can flow.

The reason why electric charges flow through a circuit is the difference in “pressure” or potential between the positive and negative nodes of the battery. This difference in potential is called electric potential or voltage (designated V) and is measured in volts (V). The resulting flow of charges is called electric current (designated I), which is measured in amperes (A). Interestingly, the direction of the flow of electric current (positive to negative) is the opposite of the direction of the flow of electrons (negative to positive). During the flow of electric current, there is also resistance (R) to its flow due to the length or shape of the conductor. The values of voltage, electric current, and resistance are dependent on each other.

There are many more nitty-gritty details to electricity but to make a potato clock this is all we need to know. The first electrical battery was made using saltwater by the Italian physicist  Alessandro Volta, in 1799. . And, you guessed it, the unit Volt is named after him.

The potato clock, invented in 1983 by William A. Borst, is a variation of Volta’s battery. And essentially, the potato clock is a clock powered by potato and can be a potato light bulb or a potato humidifier. However, the amount of electricity required to power each device will be different. There are different similarly easy ways to make a potato clock. 

For this project, we will need

- 2 potatoes
- 2 small pieces of copper wire
- 2 galvanized nails
- 3 pieces of wire with alligator clips at both ends and,
- a low volt (1-2 volt) clock.

To assemble a potato clock, start by putting 1 galvanized nail and 1 copper wire on each side of a potato. It is important that the nail and wire are not touching inside or outside of the potato. Repeat with the 2nd potato. 

Next, connect the copper wire of one potato to the positive terminal of the clock in the battery compartment (flat side) using the alligator clip wires. Similarly, connect the nail of the second potato to the negative terminal of the clock (spring side) using the wires. 

Once you make sure that none of the connections are touching each other, connect the nail of the first potato to the copper wire of the second one. Once the 3rd connection is made i.e. a closed-loop circuit is formed, the clock should start working.

This can be repeated with other fruits and vegetables containing different kinds of acids. Potatoes contain phosphoric acids and lemons contain citric acid.

This video uses slightly different materials, but is great for visualization:

As exciting as it sounds, this will not work for very long. The potato or lemon itself is not a source of energy. The potato acts as a buffer for the electrodes (galvanized nail containing zinc and copper wire) and is an electrolyte. The actual source of energy is the chemical change of zinc as it dissolves into the acid in the potato or lemon. 

In this experimental setup, copper is at a higher potential than zinc in the nail. Because of this difference in potential (Voltage), electrons flow from the zinc nail (negative terminal) through the external circuit to the copper wire (positive terminal) The circuit will only work as long as there is zinc left to be dissolved in the acid. Once the zinc-coated onto the nail is gone, there will be no electric charge produced. Thus the clock will stop working.

Despite potatoes not being the energy source, treating the potatoes before using them has shown to yield better results. In 2010, a study showed that boiling or treating the potatoes in a certain way to break down their cells can produce ten times as much energy as resistance is lowered with access to more electrons. According to this study, the Zinc-Copper electrolyte cells using potatoes can lower the energy costs significantly. In an interview with BBC.com, Professor Haim Rabinowitch from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said, “A single potato can power enough LED lamps for a room for 40 days”. This kind of energy source will create low voltage energy but it will be enough to charge mobile phones and laptops. 

Potatoes are one of the biggest food sources in the entire world and it is difficult to turn a food source into a source of electrical energy. A different research group worked with plantain piths (not consumed and thrown away), and saw similar results. Though potatoes work better, this process can be replicated with other vegetables as well.

Compared to similarly priced fuel, one liter of kerosene will only last 2 days while a Zinc strip (the actual source of energy in the potato battery) will last up to 5 months. However, the plantain pith or potato itself will likely not last that long and rot. It cannot be denied that this will be a good source of biodegradable power to millions of people who do not live in electric grids. Nevertheless, there are more things that need to be considered and worked on before commercializing this type of battery.

I find it highly exciting that a middle school science project can one day be a solution to the world’s energy crisis despite being farfetched. Till that day comes, try to power a bulb, an LED strip, or a clock with some veggies on your own kitchen table.
