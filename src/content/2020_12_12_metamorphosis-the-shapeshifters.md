Have you ever seen a cloth change into a cat? In a popular Bengali story, it did. However, that might be a little difficult in biology but you can definitely find an animal that could only breathe underwater change into an animal that can breathe on land. Whoa! Is this sorcery? Or a very natural phenomenon? Excitingly, there are real shapeshifters in nature.

All animals either hatch from eggs or are born from their mothers’ bodies. They start from a single cell, make more cells and organs, and also grow bigger. Even after birth, animals grow bigger and make different features to be more adjusted to the world around them. This process is called growth and development. For example, human babies start from a single cell and grow into a fetus before birth. We are born with about 300 bones but as we develop, some of the bones fuse together, and finally, an adult human has 206 bones.

Most animals develop in the environment they are born in. Fish take birth in water and they spend all their lives in water and that environment fulfills all their needs. However, some other animals, mainly insects and amphibians like frogs do not live in the environment they are born in. They undergo a process called metamorphosis.

The term metamorphosis has many figurative meanings but biologically it refers to the drastic changes of shape, structure, and characteristics that certain animals go through during their developmental process. Mainly insects and amphibians undergo metamorphosis but certain fish and marine invertebrates are also known to partake in this process. During the development of these animals, they acquire extreme changes in their habitat, morphology (structure and form), or reproductive stages. It is almost like these animals are shape-shifters! All these changes give them advantages in their adult lives. Before that, let’s look at an example.

Butterflies and moths undergo complete metamorphosis. They hatch from their eggs into larvae. These larvae are called caterpillars. Caterpillars have 6 legs like their adult counterpart but unlike adults, they do not have wings. These crawling caterpillars eat a lot of food and can grow 100 times their size at the time of hatching. At this feeding stage, they do not spend a lot of energy moving and store their food to be used during their adult life.

After a few weeks, with some hormonal (ecdysone) changes in the body, caterpillars stop eating and form a pupa each. This is a vulnerable stage, so the pupa generally hangs from a branch, is hidden in leaves, or is even buried. This stage lasts for about two weeks. From the outside, it looks like nothing is happening to the pupa but drastic changes are going on inside. At this stage, the larval cells dissolve and adult cells are formed giving rise to different body types, legs, and wings.

After the two weeks period, the adult butterfly or moth comes out from the shell of the pupa. Thus the metamorphosis is complete. The feeding larval stage is wingless with short antennas and small eyes and an inability to reproduce while the adult stage can fly, have longer antennas, larger eyes, and has the purpose of mating and laying eggs.

This was an example of complete metamorphosis with a life cycle of egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Some animals also exhibit incomplete or partial metamorphosis. They have several stages called nymphs since they are hatched from eggs. These stages are not very different from each other. There are differences in pigmentation, flying capability, and whether or not they can reproduce. The adult stages can fly, reproduce, and are colorful but the previous stages do not have these capabilities. Instead, in incomplete metamorphosis, the nymphs look like smaller and less capable adults.

But why do butterflies do this? Are there any benefits? Well, the biggest benefit is that caterpillars and adult butterflies eat completely different things and thus do not have to compete with each other. Butterflies drink the nectar of flowers while caterpillars eat leaves. Also, they can take advantage of the change of seasons. Caterpillars generally hatch in the summer and by fall they become butterflies that can migrate away to warmer weather (Eg. Monarch butterflies migrate from the Rocky Mountains in the north to Mexico in the south). Some insects can also spend the wintertime in pupa which gives a protective covering Since pupa don’t eat, it will be beneficial to spend the winter as a pupa as food is low at that time. Thus, undergoing metamorphosis is quite useful for these invertebrates. Did you know Oysters also undergo metamorphosis?

Frogs also undergo this process. Adult frogs lay eggs in the water and tadpoles are born in water with gills and tails. These herbivorous tadpoles start to secrete a thyroid hormone which makes changes to all the organs of their body to make them more suitable to live on land. Hindlimb and forelimb become more suited for land locomotion, the tongue becomes more suitable to catch flies, the jaw of the herbivorous tadpole changes to a jaw of a carnivorous frog, the tail, and gills disappear and even the morphology of the small intestine changes. Again, this process is beneficial to the frogs, as the tadpoles and adult frogs have very different food preferences. The tadpoles are free to acquire energy right after hatching from their environment before developing into the more intricate adult form. The adult frog can also take measures for seasonal changes.

This video is a great explanation of the process of metamorphosis in frogs:

Isn’t this such a cool process? Our natural world is so exciting and every organism has found some ways to make it easier for themselves to make the best of it. Mosquitoes, houseflies, termites, fruitflies, damselflies, mayflies, lamprey, salamanders, newts, mites, spiders, and more animals undergo complete or partial metamorphosis.

Go out, find a worm, count their legs and use the internet to find out if they are shape-shifters!
