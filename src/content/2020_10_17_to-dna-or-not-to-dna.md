All the characteristics or traits we have, come from either of our parents. It is exciting to talk about Mendelian Genetics to understand the early interpretations of genetic material. But Mendel did not know that that the alleles he found were, what we call genes now. A lot of scientists thought that genes were made of protein in the early 1900s. So, how did we arrive at DNA?

The beauty of science is that there are so many scientists in the world working on similar things. They can discuss ideas with each other, build on each other’s work, and help us understand life and the universe a little bit better.

In 1869, Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss doctor isolated DNA for the first time. Miescher, despite being a medical doctor, was more interested in researching biology. Throughout his career, he worked on white blood cells from pus, sperm from different animals, salmon from the river Rhine and nutrition in Swiss prisons. To say the least, Meischer was a versatile scientist. However, his most important contribution is considered to be the discovery of genetic material.

Meischer was working with pus from patients from a clinic near his lab in Germany. He harvested white blood cells from the pus. When he exposed these cells to different salt solutions, he found some slimy substance. He was not sure what they were but decided to look into the big nucleus of these cells. He developed a method to isolate cell nuclei and put them in similar solutions. Some white substances settled at the bottom of these solutions called a precipitate. The precipitates were unfamiliar to him. They did not behave like proteins, which biologists already knew about. Meischer named the phosphorus-rich precipitate from the nucleus of the cells, nuclein.

He did not realize the gravity of his discovery. When he worked with the sperm of different animals, he thought nuclein had a role in fertilization which led him closer to the function of DNA unknowingly. Lack of funding and poor working conditions turned him away from his work with the ‘nuclein’ which is a sad truth for a lot of scientists. Several years after his untimely demise in 1895, the significance of his discovery was truly grasped. 

A few years later, a German biochemist Albrecht Kossel in the same lab as Meischer, realized the acidic nature of nuclein and named it nucleic acid. He also found that nitrogen bases are associated with nucleic acids. Between 1885 and 1901, he isolated all the nitrogen bases and figured that these ‘nucleobases’ are important for the structure of the genetic material. For his accomplishments in cell biology, Albrecht Kossel won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1910.

After his win, he was invited to Johns Hopkins University in the USA to give a lecture. At that time in an interview with the New York Times, Kossel said, ‘The processes of life are like a drama, and I am studying the actors, not the plot. There are many actors, and it is their characters which make this drama. I seek to understand their habits, their peculiarities.’ This is very fitting as Kossel, though did not find the structure of DNA, helped push the field forward by identifying the ‘actors’, the nitrogen bases involved. Kossel also worked with proteins associated with nucleic acids.

During and after Kossel’s work, many other scientists found different information that helped understand the genetic material better. At that time it was still debated whether proteins were involved in passing on genetic information. It took the work of a lot of scientists to show that DNA was the genetic material. In 1928, British bacteriologist Frederich Griffith published what came to be known as the ‘Griffith’s experiment’ as the first step towards that.

Griffith was studying pneumonia which was a scary disease after the Spanish Flu of 1919. Griffith wanted to make a vaccine for pneumonia and thus wanted to understand the disease better. Griffith worked with 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria that he used to infect mice. One of the pneumonia strains called ‘rough’ (R) did not cause illness in mice and another strain called ‘smooth’ caused illness in mice. When these two strains were injected separately in mice, they showed the expected results. Now, with this observation, Griffith wanted to find if the S strain can still infect after killing it with heat. 

In his next set of experiments, he heat-killed the S strain and infected mice. It was found that heat-killed S strain could not cause illness in mice. He went one step further, used R strain and heat-killed S strain together to infect mice. This time the mice contracted pneumonia and died. Griffith concluded that even after heat killing there was still something present in the S strain that could ‘transform’ the live R strain and made it infectious. He named it the ‘transforming principle’. Griffith did not succeed in making a vaccine for pneumonia but provided valuable information to the understanding of genetic material. This was an exciting discovery.

A few years later, in 1944, 3 scientists – Canadian-Americans Oswald Avery and Colin McLeod and American Maclyn McCarty wanted to find what Griffith’s ‘transforming principle’ was. They started with heat-killed S strain and slowly purified its components to isolate the ‘transforming principle’. When they isolated it, they could not identify it as protein but it passed the chemical tests for nucleic acid, specifically DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA). The isolated ‘transforming principle’ also had that same amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen as DNA. To confirm, they used enzymes that break proteins (protease) and RNA (RNase) but the ‘transforming principle’ could not be broken by those. However, a DNA digesting enzyme (DNase) broke the ‘transforming principle’ into small pieces and made it non-functional. This was confirmed by adding R pneumonia cells after the enzymes and observing if S illness-causing pneumonia cells appear. For protease and RNase, illness-causing pneumonia appeared, but after using DNase, they did not.

Though these experiments supported that DNA was the ‘transforming principle’, Avery-McLeod-McCarty did not conclusively say that it was DNA as contamination could have occurred. They also likely did not want to go against all the scientists who thought proteins were involved in the genetic transfer. This is one of the instances where science might have been influenced by the then culture of scientific hypotheses. This is not uncommon in many other instances.

So, how did DNA get ‘confirmed’ as the genetic material? Who finally solved the structure of DNA? Find out in the next post!
