Did you change a light bulb recently? Or kept a plant alive on your window sill? Chances are, you used the scientific method.

When was the last time you thought about science? There will be a wide range of answers. As a scientist in the making, the answer for me will be now writing this article. If I was watching a movie, I might not focus on it. But every equipment/technique that goes into the procedure of making a movie, does require science.

Often, doing science does not have to be very active. It might be just problem solving, pranking your best friend, or finding a way to make caramel. You are probably engaging in science without knowing it. For example, when you switched on a light and the bulb did not turn on, you must have asked yourself why. This led you to an answer like the bulb is worn out and you acted upon it, solving the situation. This includes the scientific method or process of science.

Now, what is it?

It generally involves 6 steps – Observation, Question, Hypothesis (an explanation), Prediction (how we might be able to show our explanation is correct), Experiment (testing a hypothesis), and Results. At the end of the process, with supportive results, one can accept the hypothesis. That is how science is done. The man who laid out the Scientific Method is [Roger Bacon (~1214-1292)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2178622?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents).

With each step, there is some level of thought involved. You probably observe thousands of details throughout a day. Unless you find it out of the ordinary or your curious bone tickled, you might not come up with a question. You will get to a hypothesis as you try to find a possible answer to your question and a prediction when you think about how to test it. It is important to recognize that a hypothesis has to be testable and falsifiable.

What this means is, you can hypothesize that there might be other planets out there that have life, like on Earth after observing millions of stars in the night sky. However, it is not a testable or falsifiable hypothesis as you cannot actually go look at most other planets at the moment, i.e. cannot perform an experiment. The results of the experiment tell us if your hypothesis is supported or not. And analyzing the results to come up with a conclusion might be a challenge sometimes.

Nevertheless, you do not need a degree to use the scientific method. It is likely that you already use it for various tasks in your everyday life.

Let’s take an everyday life example.

**Observation:** Your car won’t start.

**Question:** Why won’t the car start?

**Hypothesis:** There is no gas in the car.

**Prediction:** If you put in more gas, the car will start.

**Experiment:** You went to the gas station, got more gas in a container and filled up the gas tank.

**Results:** The car still won’t start.

**Alternate hypothesis:** The car battery is dead.

Now, here is an important concept to understand about the scientific method. A hypothesis is an educated guess from previous background knowledge. But your first guess is likely not to be the correct explanation for your question. After experimentation, when you figure that out, there is no shame in rejecting your hypothesis and forming an alternate hypothesis. Sometimes, it might require focusing and thinking hard to come up with a different explanation. And for scientists, this whole process could be repeated countless times before they find the right answer and can show it. Often, scientists do not do it just by themselves. More on that later.

So, the next time you are faced with a situation, say your washing machine does not work or your garden is full of flowers that you did not plant, think about the process of science. Remember, you do not have to succeed and resolve the situation on your first try or alone, there is always an alternate hypothesis and many other minds to join forces with.

Here’s to Science, the incessant pursuit of truth and knowledge!
