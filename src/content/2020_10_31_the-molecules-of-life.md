Did you know once a few scientists thought DNA was made of 3 twisted strings? With the contributions of many scientists, we now know the real structure of DNA, and no, it does not have 3 strings but 2.


The structure of DNA has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (These techniques help ‘see’ very small structures). The discovery of the structure of DNA is a fascinating story. But before we go there, I want to explore the structure of DNA in some detail.

Deoxyribonucleic Acid or DNA are the molecules that encode all the information about the life of an organism. Genomes of all living organisms are made of DNA which looks like a twisted ladder. DNA has a very specific structure and a host of functions.

In this post, I will talk about the structure of DNA, officially first proposed by Watson and Crick in their groundbreaking 1953 paper.

DNA is a polymer. Think of a chain; it is made up of numerous chainlinks. If you want to increase or decrease the size of the chain you add more links or remove links. For DNA, the chainlinks are made up of a phosphate group attached to a deoxyribose sugar. These are connected to one of the 2 types of bases – purine and pyrimidine. There are 2 purine bases – adenine and guanine and 2 pyrimidine bases – thymine and cytosine. The phosphate group, the deoxyribose sugar, and any one of the bases together form one chainlink or a monomer.

When the phosphate group of one monomer connects to the sugar of another, the polymer starts to form. One strand of DNA can contain thousands of such units. This also gives directionality to the DNA strand. The end where the phosphate group is at the terminal is called 5’ (5 prime) end and the other side where the sugar is at the terminal is called 3’ (3 prime) end. But wait, why isn’t one of the bases at the end? Let’s find out.

Each type of base can form bonds with another type. This means if a specific type of purine is close to a specific type of pyrimidine, they can ‘hold hands’ and stay close to each other. This helps the DNA keep the two strands close to one another.
Adenine (A) forms bonds with thymine (T) and guanine (G) forms bonds with cytosine (C). Those bonds are very specific. A will always bond with T while G will always bond with C. This is called base pairing. As the phosphate group and the sugar are the same for all the units, each unit of the DNA polymer is recognized by the bases it contains. The sequence of a DNA strand can be written as a sequence of A, T, G, and C.

The bonds between these specific bases give DNA its most interesting property of DNA. Once you have the sequence of one strand you can very easily get the sequence of the other strand i.e the complementary strand. Since every base forms very specific bonds, this is possible. Thus if you have a molecule of DNA, the number of purines will be equal to the number of pyrimidines.

Let’s take an example. We have one strand of DNA whose sequence is 5’ATGGCTA3’. The sequence of the complementary strand can be found just by remembering which base bonds with which. So the other strand will be derived 3’TACCGAT5’. This means if you have one strand of DNA you can always sequence the other strand. Using this, if you find an unknown DNA, you can synthesize its complementary strand and thus indirectly find out the sequence of the unknown strand.  This method is called DNA fingerprinting and is used to solve crimes or do paternity tests.

Did you notice that the 3’ end and the 5’ end are opposite to each other? This makes the two strands of DNA antiparallel or running opposite to each other.

The DNA strands together form a right-handed helix, i.e. it is twisted to the right. The strands maintain a certain distance and have twists at a specified length. The ribbon in the picture below represents the phosphate-sugar backbone of DNA while the rungs of the twisted ladder are the bonds between the bases. The distance between the same strand overlapping from the front is called a major groove. The distance between alternate strands overlapping is called a minor groove. Each major groove has 10 base pairings.

DNA can make copies of itself which makes it a unique molecule and what makes life possible. There is a vast storage of information about DNA, its properties, and functions that I will bring up in future posts.

DNA is present in every cell of every living organism. It is microscopic and was elusive for a long time. But we have found out so much about the molecule of life in the last 100 years or so. This makes understanding biology easier and open to more avenues towards answers.
