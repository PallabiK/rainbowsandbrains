Growing up in a huge congested city, for the longest time, I thought rainbows were probably a myth. Or something that only people who are really lucky can see.

One day when I was 12, on my way back from school on the school bus, I, suddenly, heard other students sitting behind me shout and run to the back window. When I made out what they were saying, I realized one of them saw a rainbow. I looked out of my nearest window and all I could see were buildings. I tried to go to the back window of the bus but there was already a crowd. After a minute or so, everyone went back to their seats. I felt this hollow that I missed it and I might never have a chance to see another rainbow ever again.

The first rainbow that I ever remember seeing was right outside my undergrad college. This college was situated 2 or so kilometers outside my birth city. In the first month of college, on a rainy day, with my new friends, I saw it, a rainbow. Looking back, it was a defining moment. From my introverted school days, I became at least an ambivert college kid who talked to a lot of people, exchanged ideas, held leadership positions, and went for what she wanted. Nothing was impossible. Nothing was unseeable. Nothing was unobservable anymore.

The feeling of freedom means a lot to me. I have felt constrained in lots of ways growing up, so when in college, I was not seen as just a geek who could not speak in public, I spoke my mind left and right but in the back of the head, I still felt imposter syndrome. I still do. One of the bigger questions is why will anyone be interested in what I have to say. Maybe I am just forcing my thoughts out to the world.

I have always been a voracious reader. In high school, social media posts were added to my reading list. Slowly, I felt my world broaden and include things even if I didn’t know they existed. For a while, I was quick to believe everything, but then I learned to filter through the untrue to get to the true stuff. I am still not sure about my success rate though.

In this process, I learned about this whole world of meaning attached to rainbows. I became an ally. 

When it came to naming my blog, which is going to be unlike my juvenile dabbles with blogging, I wanted to mean something close to me. I am a scientist or at least on the way to officially be one. I like philosophical discussions. I love reading. I draw and dabble in other forms of art like crafts, dance, and even trying to play a musical instrument. I wanted my blog to be all-inclusive. Everything that concocted in a brain. I want to communicate science along with philosophy and art. I want to put my thoughts out in the universe. And that’s what this blog is for.
