What comes to your mind when you hear the word ‘Evolution’? Maybe the set of pictures where the primates evolve to humans. Maybe the presence of such a huge number of species on Earth. Maybe survival of the fittest or natural selection.

The big changes that are seen as evolution are just a part of it. Evolution is not just the formation of new species. That is a big step. But there are many tiny steps which are also evolution. This post aims at highlighting all the ways evolution can happen.

First, what is evolution? Evolution is the change in the gene pool of a population over generations. The gene pool is the set of characteristics or traits of all organisms in a population. A population is defined as a group of interbreeding organisms isolated from other organisms of the same species. Evolution is the change in the gene frequency in a population over time.

Charles Darwin, an English naturalist was the first to officially put forward the concept of evolution.
Darwin, in his early 20s, sailed to the Galapagos islands (1831-1836) as a gentleman naturalist and companion to the captain of the ship HMS Beagle. On the way there, they made several stops and Darwin learned more and more about different animals from fossils, encounters, anecdotes, and a great deal of data. In the Galapagos, he noticed different types of mockingbirds on different islands as well as the variety in other birds like finches. He returned with burning questions and possible answers hidden in his data.

It was not until 1859, over 20 years later, when he published his theory of evolution – ‘On the Origin of the Species by means of natural selection’. In the years after his return from the Galapagos, he worked with other scientists, analyzed his data, and developed his inklings into the now-accepted theory. There was no one ‘eureka’ moment for Darwin. It took hard work, a long time, and meticulously following the process of science.

The main findings of Darwin were:

- A species is a group of interbreeding organisms that can have fertile offsprings.
- Living organisms have descended from other living organisms with some modifications.
- The process of natural selection provides meaningful insight into the different species of living things present on Earth.

Now, what is Natural Selection? And why is it important? Before we go there, we have to understand the many different ways evolution occurs. There are 5 ways in which the gene frequencies in a population can change.


1. If the population shrinks and individuals with specific traits die, the gene frequency for that trait will change. The gene pool will be defined by the genes of the surviving individuals. With this change in the gene pool, evolution will have occurred.
2. Evolution depends on which genes get passed on. If individuals find mates who are vastly different from them and add those genes to the gene pool of the population, over time the gene frequency will change and evolution will occur.
3. There are many random mutations in individuals in a population. If these mutations can be passed on to the next generation which brings changes in characteristics, it will change the existing gene pool thus causing evolution.
4. If individuals from a population migrate to a different population, the gene frequency of certain traits can change in the second population leading to evolution.
5. Last but not least is natural selection. In this process, a population better adapts to an environmental stressor i.e. nature selects which traits from that population are better suited. This is the only process that can lead to the formation of new species.

For example, some guppies are brightly colored and some are dull. Some populations of guppies have a predator like a cichlid fish nearby. In waters where more predation is present, guppies tend to be duller as brightly colored fish are easily spotted by a predator. But in low predation areas, they are brightly colored. Natural selection affects if the guppies will be brightly colored or dull by the presence of a stressor like a predator.

The five processes of evolution are very well summarized in the video below.

Now that we know about how evolution can occur, let’s think about how often it happens.
Did you know, we can observe evolution occur within a few years? Biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant saw the beaks of finches evolve twice in a span of ten years depending on the environmental stressors. The Grants have been studying Darwin’s finches in the Galapagos for over 40 years now.

They studied medium ground finches which had a range of beak sizes between 7 and 11 mm. Thus they had a range of food sources from small soft seeds to large hard seeds. In 1977, when drought struck, the only food source that remained available was the large hard seeds (environmental stressor). Finches with bigger beaks had an advantage there and they are the only ones that survived. Thus their offsprings had bigger beaks on average. So the population shifted from a mix of beaks to mainly medium and large beaks.

Later after heavy rainfall for a few years when drought struck again, the smaller softer seeds were abundant. With the shifting of the food source, the finches with smaller beaks had an advantage and in their offsprings, this was reflected. This led to an increase in birds with smaller beaks and thus the gene frequency of the population shifted from mainly medium and large beaked birds to mainly birds with smaller beaks.

However, the formation of new species or takes millions of years. Populations can often get geographically separated and become two separate populations that do not interbreed. In different environments, different characteristics are favored over others and thus evolution occurs differently in the two populations. The little changes build up and led to different appearances, dissimilar food sources, and incompatible mating habits. Thus if the two populations meet up again, they will not be able to interbreed and produce fertile offsprings. They will have become different species. And this process takes a long time, depending on how different their environmental conditions are.

The stories of how organisms adapt to their environment and evolve are increasingly appealing. Locate a plant, a bird, or an insect around your house, go to Google Scholar, and find out how they evolved! You might be surprised.
