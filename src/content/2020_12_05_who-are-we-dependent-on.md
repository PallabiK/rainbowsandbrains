Can you survive alone on this planet? With no other living beings, just you. Do you think you will be able to exist? Probably not. Living beings are intricately dependent on one another to stay alive. These relationships between each living being with their surrounding (that consists of millions of living beings) make an ecosystem.

An ecosystem consists of living and non-living things. They are all related to each other by the flow of energy and nutrients. Energy is added into the system when plants take in energy from the sun by photosynthesis and store it in their body parts. The plants then serve as food for different kinds of animals. This way, energy is passed from plants to animals. These animals in turn are eaten by other animals who might also be eaten by other animals. When these living beings die, microorganisms decompose their bodies and return the trapped nutrients to nature. The producers release oxygen as a byproduct of making food. The oxygen is used by most living beings (including all plants, animals, and most microorganisms) during respiration. Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of respiration which is taken up by plants during photosynthesis, thus maintaining the oxygen-carbon dioxide balance in nature.

Examples of significant ecosystems are forests, grasslands, freshwater, marine, deserts, and tundra.

The living beings which can trap the energy of the sun and turn it into food for other animals are called producers. Our main producers are plants but certain microorganisms like algae (including diatoms) can also perform photosynthesis. Feeding on the producers is primary consumers or herbivores. These organisms like caterpillars, giraffes, shrimps, and more, feed on the producers. Secondary consumers or carnivores feed on primary consumers. Lions, praying mantis and cichlid are among animals that feed on other animals. Tertiary consumers can be carnivores eating other carnivores or omnivores that can feed on any of the above types. Owls, humans, and barracuda are part of tertiary consumers. Secondary and tertiary consumers are often called predators while anything that the predator feeds on is called prey. When all these animals and plants die, they are decomposed by microorganisms.

In a stable sustainable ecosystem, the number of producers is the highest, next are the primary consumers and then the secondary consumers. Tertiary consumers make up the least number of living beings in an ecosystem. This can be represented as a pyramid that was first visualized by Charles Elton in 1927 in his book Animal Ecology. This pyramid is called an ecological pyramid and shows how a sustainable ecosystem should have most producers and fewer consumers.

Charles Elton also elaborated on the concepts of the food chain and food web.
The food chain is a linear relationship between producers, consumers, and decomposers. For example, aquatic plants (including algae) are producers that are eaten by water snails, tadpoles, or fly larvae (primary consumers). The primary consumers are eaten by carnivorous fish. When all these organisms die, they are broken down by microorganisms. This relationship seems linear and is thus termed the food chain.

However, in reality, the relationship between plants and different animals are not that simple. A single animal can be a part of several food chains. Thus the interconnected food chains form a food web that is particular to a single ecosystem. The fly larvae in the water can be eaten by frogs that are eaten by snakes that are eaten by hawks. The frogs can also be eaten by owls that also feed on hawk eggs and snakes. Cranes and ducks eat carnivorous fish. These birds can also be eaten by hawks. This intricate connection between different animals and plants can be described by food webs.

Can you figure out how you are related to the animals or plants around you? It might not be a direct relation but indirect through other animals and plants. Do this exercise with the next living being you see and you can become an expert on figuring out food webs. Take help from others on the internet who has already figured some food webs out. It is incredible to realize we are dependent on all living beings around us.
