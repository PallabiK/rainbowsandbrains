The tiny face high in the air, the cute horns, and the soulful eyes. Giraffes are the long-necked beauties of Africa. I have only seen them in zoos but I long to see them in their natural habitat.

Giraffes are such an obscure animal for the rest of the world. We know that they have long necks, mini horns (called ossicones), and patterned coats. But are all giraffes the same? Where do they live? How did they get their long necks? Let’s see if we can find some of the answers.

Giraffes (Original scientific name: Giraffa camelopardalis) live in open grasslands in small herds, usually around six individuals. The nine subspecies of giraffes are spread throughout the continent of Africa – from Chad in the North to South Africa in the south, from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east.

Giraffes have hump-like camels and are spotted like leopards. Initially, they were thought to be a combination of camels and leopards which gave giraffes the species name ‘camelopardalis’. However, giraffes are related to certain deers, sheep, goats, cows, etc. The coat pattern of giraffes is quite interesting. It is unique for each giraffe. Like our thumbprints! Although the giraffes living in the same area look similar, giraffes from different populations have vastly different coat colors and patterns. It was generally accepted that there are 9 subspecies of giraffes but in 2016, a study used DNA analysis and found 4 species of giraffe instead of just one. These 4 subspecies have not interbred for over a million years and thus have evolved into separate species.

Giraffes can be as tall as 5.8m (19ft) with just their legs as well as necks about 1.8m (6ft) tall each. Giraffes weigh between 800 and 1300 kgs (1750 to 2800 lbs). Male giraffes are called bulls while females are called cows and baby giraffes are called calves. Quite like cows, giraffes bring up their food from the stomach and spend a lot of time chewing. As the world’s tallest mammal, giraffes have to eat a lot of food. Their 45-54cm (18-21in) long tongues come in handy while they are browsing for leaves from tall trees. Thus, giraffes move around a lot in search of food. They can run at a speed of about 56km/hr (35mph) and can travel longer distances at 16km/hr (10mph). Giraffes spend 16-20 hours a day eating or searching for food.

Having long necks and legs, giraffes have to carefully maneuver themselves while drinking water. They have to spread their front legs and then lower their neck to the watering hole. This is also when they are the most unguarded and open to attacks from predators like lions, spotted hyenas, leopards, and African wild dogs.
Most of a giraffe’s day is spent on eating and being on the lookout for predators. But when do they sleep? Turns out adult giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep every 24 hours. They sleep standing or sometimes leaning. Young giraffes can sleep for closer to 5 hours. Female giraffes give birth or deliver their calves standing up. Thus a calf is welcomed into this world with a 1.5m (5ft) drop. Interestingly, the calves can stand up in half an hour and run with their herd in as little as ten hours. Imagine a human baby running ten hours after birth!

Giraffes are closely related to another mammal called Okapi. With seven Giraffe species already extinct, the nine subspecies still living in Africa are deemed ‘Vulnerable’. This means there is severe loss of giraffe habitat but there is still time to combat the problem. 

Through millions of years of evolution, modern giraffes have long necks with long legs. Have you ever wondered how giraffes have such long necks?
Jean Baptiste-Lamarck in the early 1800s had a theory. Since giraffes lived in dry areas where there are either shrubs or high trees, Lamarck thought ancestors of giraffes focused on the higher leaves instead of competing with other browsers for shrubs. In their struggle, short-necked giraffe ancestors developed longer necks with front legs longer than hind legs by stretching their necks. He thought, every generation of giraffes practiced this behavior and the length of their necks increased every generation. Thus we ended up with the long-necked giraffe. 

However, since Darwin, we now know that is not how evolution occurs. Evolution occurs over a whole population and not at an individual level. There are two main hypotheses that explain the long neck of the giraffe.
(Remember ‘hypothesis’ from ‘How does science happen?’).

Competing browsers hypothesis: As Lamarck suggested, ancestors of giraffes likely competed with various other browsers in the grasslands of Africa. Darwin thought, with the scarcity of food during dry seasons, the giraffes who had longer necks had an advantage as they could eat the leaves on the trees instead of competing for the shrubs. These giraffes were more successful and healthy and could reproduce better, thus they passed their longer neck genes on to the next generation. With natural selection working on the giraffes, long-necked giraffes evolved who were better at getting food, traveling longer distances (due to longer legs) in search of food, and thus surviving. 

Neck-for-sex hypothesis: Necks are useful in combat between males to impress a female giraffe. Necks have evolved as a weapon or tool for intrasexual (within the same sex, here males) struggles between male giraffes when they are competing for an adult female giraffe. This is also called sexual selection. There are differences in the neck structures of bull and cow giraffes. Also, when compared with closely related browsers like okapi and giraffe fossils, it is seen that there is specific selection pressure on the length of the neck compared to the total length of the vertebral column. This evidence supports the neck-for-sex hypothesis.

However,  another study refutes this idea as there are no significant differences between the lengths of necks of bull and cow giraffes. If long necks were a result of sexual selection, females would have shorter necks. On the other hand, giraffes have had necks that are 2m longer than their tallest competing browsers for over a million years. This challenges the ‘competitive browsers’ hypothesis as otherwise, there should have been browsers of different in-between neck lengths. The challenge to the sexual selection hypothesis is the long neck of the females.

It is likely that the long necks of giraffes evolved with a mix of both hypotheses. Along with being a competitive browser, giraffes also used neck-for-sex. However, the relative importance of each theory is still debated.

Giraffes are fascinating creatures that tower over everything in the grasslands of Africa. There is much more information about them out there. I highly recommend following one of the links below to find out more about giraffes. After all these long-necked beauties deserve our love and attention.
