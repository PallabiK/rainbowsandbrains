As a child, I was often asked, ‘What do you want to become when you grow up?’ This was a reality check for me, realizing what you HAVE to be something when you grow up. Why?

When I was 11, I thought of 5 options that I could ‘be’ – a detective, a doctor, a dancer, a scientist or an astronaut. As I grew older, the only option that remained was being a doctor as that was a family expectation. However, in the deepest of my desires, I did not want that for myself. I wanted to explore and not have specific responsibilities in someone’s life. Of course, that seems a little escapist now but I wanted to explore the world and explore the life in it. That will be a future talking point.

Now, why should anyone want to become a scientist when a lot of other jobs pay so much better? The first important question to ask yourself is, ‘what gives me joy?’ If the answer is related to not having work hours set by someone else, applying creativity in your work, and thinking about the world around you, ask yourself the next three questions to check.

1. Do you want to find out how things work? I always feel great when I can figure out how a magician did their trick. Science lets you look behind the curtain. Oh, the fly is just always a fraction of a second faster than me. How?
2. Do you want to find out why things are the way they are? The apple always falls on the ground. Why?
3. Do you enjoy meeting new people? Being a scientist, you can travel to different places and meet new people.

It is a common misconception that all scientists live in laboratories with colorful liquids. 
The third one is the most important factor in my decision. Depending on what kind of scientist you are, you may never have to see the inside of a lab. Apart from working on your research, you can go to different conferences and meet people from all around the world. Also, if you are interested in science communication, you not only meet other scientists from your field but everyone.

There is likely a myriad of other reasons to become a scientist. For me, it was the chance to be able to solve even one of the world’s ‘mysteries’. And you can do it all by following the [process of science](https://rainbowsandbrains.com/how-does-science-happen/).

It is important to remember that science is not a ‘lone’ endeavor. Charles Singer, a historian of science, said that [‘Science is knowledge in the making’](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2415517/). This knowledge does not come suddenly all at once or from one mind. There are rigorous methods and precautions that scientists take to derive results to support their hypothesis. However, scientists are often wrong. The beauty of science is that you can try again and find the right answer. Most importantly, you can work with other scientists.

The pursuit of knowledge and truth that scientists embark on is not always easy; it is enthralled with emotions. The joy of supporting your hypothesis, the crippling anxiety of not making progress, the heartbreak of an experiment failing, and the thrill of finding a new way and succeeding; all comes with being a scientist. And everything goes back to the process of science. If you have to reject your hypothesis, that is not the end; you just find an alternate explanation and continue.

The victory of adding a tiny part of information to the vast repository of science makes being a scientist and everything that comes along worth it.
