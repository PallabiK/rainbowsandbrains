Have you heard about Pavlov and his dog?

In the early 20th century, Pavlov noticed that his dog salivated automatically when there was meat nearby but the dog had no specific reaction to a ringing bell. So, Pavlov designed an experiment where he rang a bell at the same time when the dog was served meat. After some time, the dog would salivate whenever the bell rang, even in the absence of meat.

Pavlov was a physiologist and not particularly interested in animal behavior. Despite his use of non-ideal methods, he provided an objective way to measure animal behavior and its connection to psychology. This is a popular story related to the exciting branch of biology, called ethology or the study of animal behavior. 

Animal Behavior is everything that animals do. This includes all activities including movement and the decisions behind them. It is also finding out why and how animals show these behaviors.

This branch of biology unofficially started over 150 years ago with Charles Darwin with the publication of his theory of evolution. Darwin’s theory provided a clearer perspective for studying biology and a guide for delving into the exciting new world of animal behavior. Let’s find out how this is done.

Like humans, all other animals have different sense organs that they use to perceive their environment and to respond to cues or signals. A collection of these responses is termed as behavior. Many of these behaviors are innate (genetic/present since birth) like breathing and some behaviors are learned over the lifetime like cycling or checking both ways before crossing a street. Most animals have these innate and learned behaviors.

Now, do you like crickets? Sometimes their chirps annoy me but my curiosity is piqued by their jumping movements. Why do they jump? An answer would be to get to something or to get away from something or both. Thinking about other animals we have seen, probably the cricket wants to get to a mate or prey to eat and get away from a predator. But how does a cricket know if there is a mate or predator? How does it decide whether to go towards something or away?

An experiment was done in 1978, where a cricket was fixed on a platform. The cricket could still move but not fly away. Sounds were played through a speaker at different frequencies. It was seen that the crickets turned towards the speakers at sound frequencies 3-9 kilohertz (kHz) but they turned away from the speaker at 30-70 kHz. If their directionality is taken as the direction they will fly to, it can be inferred that the crickets want to go towards lower frequencies but get away from higher frequencies. Interestingly, it was found that crickets make sounds at 3-9 kHz i.e. to find mates the crickets will go towards sounds at these frequencies. On the other hand, their predators like bats use ultrasonic echolocation at 30-70kHz, i.e they want to escape when they hear these frequencies.

Thus natural selection played a role in the evolution of these animals’ behaviors. They have a keen hearing for other crickets and ultrasonic hearing for their predators. Biologist Dobzhansky said ‘Nothing in Biology makes sense, except in the light of evolution’. 

Now think about all the animals you have observed over your life. If you have not, that should be your next task – to observe an animal for 5 minutes. What were these animals doing? Maybe, you failed to swat at a fly or saw a rabbit in your garden. How do they do certain things and why? These are questions that have been asked for almost a hundred years now and some answers have been found.

The field of animal behavior became mainstream and a separate focus of study with scientists like Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen. Lorenz is called the ‘Father of modern Ethology’. There were many scientists who worked with animals to understand animal behavior prior to Lorenz and Tinbergen. Charles Turner’s contribution to studying insects and developing scientific ways to perform experiments went unnoticed for a long time. However, with winning the Nobel Prize in 1973 in Physiology or Medicine, Lorenz and Tinbergen along with Karl von Frisch brought this field into the public eye. There are hundreds of ethologists now who are working on different animals. All the questions these scientists are asking are thrilling.

Next time you observe an animal and you have a question, use Google Scholar to find out about all the cool research on that animal. If you don’t find an answer, think of an explanation.

Maybe your hypothesis will be the one supported by experimental results!
