Have you thought about what makes life possible? The tiny self-copying units called DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) are present in all living cells on Earth. But how did we find out about them? What do they do? What do they look like?

The detailed process of understanding DNA took over 100 years. The discovery of DNA is a fascinating story and has many players like any other scientific discovery. As mentioned in Together We Science, discoveries do not happen out of the blue but step-by-step and a lot of great minds are involved. This story is long and thus, will be told in a few parts. 

How is it that you can roll your tongue but your parents can’t? Or maybe the other way round. People from the same family have different characteristics. Or maybe someone has eyes like their grandmother but not like their parents. The reason for all of this can be found out through the study of Genetics. Now, let’s talk about the person who started it. This post will focus on an Austrian monk and his garden of peas.

Gregor Johann Mendel was born in 1822 in Austria. After looking at different prospects for a career and completing extensive education, Mendel, a monk, started teaching at a secondary school in the 1850s. In his garden, he noticed pea plants that had different characteristics. Plants were either tall or short, seed coats were brown or white, seeds were round or wrinkled, and so on. But these properties did not always appear together. Tall plants could have either brown or white seed coats; short plants could have either round or wrinkled seeds. These observations aroused curiosity in Mendel. If one of the parent plants was tall and the other was short, what would be the height of their children? Mendel designed experiments to test his theories. He took the first steps toward understanding genetics.

In his experiments, Mendel controlled the pollination of the pea plants. This means he controlled that pollen (male sex cells)  from a specific plant went to a specific flower.  His treatments involved pollinating plants with opposite traits and examining their children. Mendel found that there are 7 characteristics or traits of the plants with 2 different possibilities or alleles each. One of the alleles is dominant and one of the alleles is recessive (these only show up if there is another of its kind). Each plant always has 2 alleles for one trait. This means a plant can have 2 of the same alleles (2 dominants or 2 recessives) or they could be mixed and matched where they have 1 dominant and 1 recessive allele. If a plant has 2 of the same alleles for a trait, it is called homozygous. If the alleles are mixed and matched, it is called heterozygous and the plant looks like the dominant trait. Mendel conducted several experiments to find out how these alleles or traits are passed down to the next generation.

With his experimental results, Mendel came up with 2 theories, called Mendel’s laws of inheritance.

First, he found that for any trait, each parent’s pairing of alleles split, and one allele passes from each parent to a child.  Which particular allele in a pair gets passed on is completely up to chance. This is called the law of segregation. The ratio of the children with different traits in different generations showed which traits are dominant or recessive and how they are passed to the next generation.

For example, Mendel started with plants that had homozygous purple flowers and homozygous white flowers. This is called the parental (P) generation. When these plants were cross-pollinated, their next-generation had all purple flowers. This was called the first filial (F1) generation. Did the white flower allele disappear? Next, plants from the F1 generation were self-pollinated and white flowers reappeared in the 2nd Filial (F2) generation along with purple flower plants. The ratio of purple to white flower plants in the F2 generation was 3:1. This shows that the white allele was not lost in the F1 generation, it was just dominated by the purple allele. This means, even if the plant has purple flowers if it has a secret white flower allele, it can be passed on separately to the next generation. When making reproductive cells (gametes), the 2 alleles of a trait are always separated (segregated) and go to different children.

Second, he found that different pairs of alleles are passed onto the children independently of each other. If a plant has both tall and short alleles and alleles for both purple and white flowers, it will appear tall with purple flowers. Their gametes can have different combinations of the alleles – tall and purple, tall and white, short and purple, or short and white. Therefore, the inheritance of genes at one location in a genome does not influence the inheritance of genes at another location. This is called the law of independent assortment. This law shows that dominant alleles of different traits are not always together but neither are recessive alleles, they can be mixed and matched in various ways while forming gametes.

If you can roll your tongue, chances are one or both your parents can roll theirs too as tongue-rolling is a dominant allele. If both your parents have blue eyes, you cannot have brown eyes. As blue eye color is a recessive allele, it can only be expressed when there are two of a kind. If you know the alleles of a couple, you can predict the chances of their kid having that allele. This works for predicting the probability of having genetic diseases as well.

Can you find some other examples in yourself or people around you?

Mendel did not get everything right. Many things were unknown back then, there was no modern equipment.  But Mendel formed the basics of studying genetics. For his contributions to understanding the passing down of traits, Mendel is called the ‘Father of Genetics’. The results of Mendel’s experiments were not popular until 1901 when William Bateson translated Mendel’s work from German into English.

Mendel’s peas led to one of the first steps to understanding DNA and how it works. To understand Mendel’s laws better, start with Wikipedia and then check out the other sources at the end of this article.
