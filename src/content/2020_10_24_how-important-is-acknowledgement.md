Until 1952, the big question still remained. Was DNA without a doubt the genetic material or was it protein? With all the dedicated scientists working towards finding the truth, it did not evade us for long.

In 1952, American scientists, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase worked with viruses that attack bacteria, called bacteriophages. Bacteriophages attach to bacteria and inject something (DNA or protein) into the bacteria that contain the ‘instructions’ to make more bacteriophages.

With the information that, sulfur is present in protein but not in DNA while phosphorus is present in DNA but not in proteins, radioactive sulfur and radioactive phosphorus were used to produce two separate batches of viruses. Thus, if radioactivity from sulfur was seen in the bacteria, the protein could be confirmed as genetic material but if radioactivity from phosphorus was detected, DNA would be crowned as the genetic material.

These two types of radioactive viruses were used to separately infect bacteria in separate containers. After infection, the two containers were processed to separate the virus from the bacteria and all four (two fractions of viruses and two fractions of bacteria) were tested for radioactivity. The phage with radioactive sulfur had radioactivity but the bacteria did not. On the other hand, the virus with radioactive phosphorus did not have radioactivity but the bacteria did. This showed that the ‘instructions’ that the virus passed into the bacteria were made of DNA with radioactive phosphorus. Thus, it was confirmed that DNA is the genetic material that is passed on from the virus to the bacteria.

Alfred Hershey won the Nobel Prize for his discoveries in 1969 but Chase was not a part of it. Key members of the research were not always acknowledged as well as they should be. This discrimination occurred based on gender and/or race. In the next story, this might look like a pattern.

Even while DNA was not confirmed as the genetic material, scientists were trying to find out what DNA looks like. The structure of the DNA was an important key to finding out how it worked and why.

Rosalind Franklin was a British biophysicist and chemist. Born in 1920, Franklin was a brilliant scientist and worked on the porosity of coal for the British government during World War II. For this work, she was awarded her Ph.D. in 1945 by the University of Cambridge. After this, she worked in France perfecting her use of x-ray crystallography. This process helps visualize the structure of small crystalline objects. Her success in scientific research brought her an invitation to work in King’s College, London with Dr. Maurice Wilkins in 1950.

There are speculations about why Franklin and Wilkins did not continue to work together. But, they started working separately on the same topic. Franklin, having mastered X-ray crystallography, used that technique. She was a robust scientist and published five to ten papers a year and had an excellent work ethic. She worked with her student, R. G. Gosling at this time. As her work progressed, she was making strides in putting her finger on the exact structure of DNA.

In 1953, April 25, a groundbreaking paper came out in Nature, proposed by two young scientists, J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick, called ‘Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A structure of Deoxyribonucleic Acid’. This paper identified DNA as a double helix with phosphate on the outside and bases on the inside. This was novel as earlier that year, two other scientists, Linus Pauling and Robert B. Corey proposed a DNA structure with 3 intertwined chains and phosphate groups on the inside with bases on the outside. Watson and Crick’s landmark paper identified each structural property of the DNA which was later confirmed by different scientists.

For their accomplishment, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. At this point, you might ask, what was Wilkins’ contribution? In Watson and Crick’s 1953 paper Wilkins was acknowledged as well as Franklin. Why?

It was later found out that in January 1953, Wilkins, not making much progress himself in discovering the structure of DNA himself, went to Crick and Watson who worked in Cambridge on the same topic. Wilkins knew Franklin was making huge progress. Without her permission, Wilkins showed Watson and Crick some unpublished data of Franklin on the structure of DNA which included the famous Photo 51.

Watson and Crick quickly understood what the photo meant about how the structure of DNA should look like and in 3 months, they published their paper. This would not have been possible at all without Franklin’s Photo 51. But proper credit was not given where it was due. In March 1953, Franklin sent two papers to the press without any inkling of Watson and Crick’s paper. They contained X-ray Crystallography photographs of A and B forms of DNA. The B form is what aligns with Watson and Crick model. The A form although is a double helix has slightly different properties. These contributions were not important enough but Wilkins’ contribution (sharing unauthorized unpublished data) was.

The story of DNA continues on after this with more discoveries and applications. For now, I will pause here and discuss something else.

I learned about the discovery of the structure of DNA and the scientists, Watson and Crick by the time I was in Class 9. However, the first time I heard about Rosalind Franklin was in the 2nd year of my Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry for Biology class. I was fortunate to have a very righteous teacher who made sure we as a class grasped the importance of Dr. Franklin’s contributions. He even made us perform creative skits on the story of the discovery of DNA to make sure we really appreciated it.

It was probably insignificant in the grand scheme of things but it instilled in me a deep sense of injustice. How some contributions can be so easily overlooked. How our society is so eager to accept the idea of a ‘lone’ genius or a couple of them when they are from a certain race and/or sex. 

Rosalind Franklin passed away in 1958, 4 years before the Nobel Prize was awarded. Then it was just convenient to forget about her. But there are people like my professor and A. Klug, Franklin’s colleague who inherited her research, who did not sit idly by. Maybe, her recognition was late but she cannot be forgotten, the fierce and brilliant scientist she was.

Women in science have had a long struggle. I am sure there are countless women like Martha Chase and Rosalind Franklin, who did not get their due acknowledgment. But it’s high time sexism and racism in science are dealt with. We have come a long way but there is still more hard work to do. 

Acknowledgment is as important as representation in Science. They both go hand-in-hand in some ways. If you want to study science, go for it. With your uniqueness, you will be an inspiration for the next generation.
