It is exciting to talk about Mendelian Genetics to understand the early interpretations of genetic material. But Mendel did not know that that the alleles he found were, what we call genes now. A lot of scientists thought that genes were made of protein in the early 1900s. So, how did we arrive at DNA?\n\nThe beauty of science is that there are so many scientists in the world working on similar things. They can discuss ideas with each other, build on each other’s work, and help us understand life and the universe a little bit better.\n\nIn 1869, Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss doctor isolated DNA for the first time. Miescher, despite being a medical doctor, was more interested in researching biology. Throughout his career, he worked on white blood cells from pus, sperm from different animals, salmon from the river Rhine and nutrition in Swiss prisons. To say the least, Meischer was a versatile scientist. However, his most important contribution is considered to be the discovery of genetic material.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1HeX18YMR6-hwI97n9bNHYAxuPN9jBfx0\">\n  <figcaption>White Blood Cells</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nMeischer was working with pus from patients from a clinic near his lab in Germany. He harvested white blood cells from the pus. When he exposed these cells to different salt solutions, he found some slimy substance. He was not sure what they were but decided to look into the big nucleus of these cells. He developed a method to isolate cell nuclei and put them in similar solutions. Some white substances settled at the bottom of these solutions called a precipitate. The precipitates were unfamiliar to him. They did not behave like proteins, which biologists already knew about. Meischer named the phosphorus-rich precipitate from the nucleus of the cells, nuclein.\n\nHe did not realize the gravity of his discovery. When he worked with the sperm of different animals, he thought nuclein had a role in fertilization which led him closer to the function of DNA unknowingly. Lack of funding and poor working conditions turned him away from his work with the ‘nuclein’ which is a sad truth for a lot of scientists. Several years after his untimely demise in 1895, the significance of his discovery was truly grasped. \n\nA few years later, a German biochemist Albrecht Kossel in the same lab as Meischer, realized the acidic nature of nuclein and named it nucleic acid. He also found that nitrogen bases are associated with nucleic acids. Between 1885 and 1901, he isolated all the nitrogen bases and figured that these ‘nucleobases’ are important for the structure of the genetic material. For his accomplishments in cell biology, Albrecht Kossel won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1910.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=12D5dfSWrYkxhNgSez_acsp_9zu3As81Y\">\n</figure>\n\n\nAfter his win, he was invited to Johns Hopkins University in the USA to give a lecture. At that time in an interview with the New York Times, Kossel said, ‘The processes of life are like a drama, and I am studying the actors, not the plot. There are many actors, and it is their characters which make this drama. I seek to understand their habits, their peculiarities.’ This is very fitting as Kossel, though did not find the structure of DNA, helped push the field forward by identifying the ‘actors’, the nitrogen bases involved. Kossel also worked with proteins associated with nucleic acids.\n\nDuring and after Kossel’s work, many other scientists found different information that helped understand the genetic material better. At that time it was still debated whether proteins were involved in passing on genetic information. It took the work of a lot of scientists to show that DNA was the genetic material. In 1928, British bacteriologist Frederich Griffith published what came to be known as the ‘Griffith’s experiment’ as the first step towards that.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1C6aimTSPRQxa90920PwGbd97DBqi95sI\">\n  <figcaption>Griffith’s Experiment (Inspired by Madeleine Price Ball)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nGriffith was studying pneumonia which was a scary disease after the Spanish Flu of 1919. Griffith wanted to make a vaccine for pneumonia and thus wanted to understand the disease better. Griffith worked with 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria that he used to infect mice. One of the pneumonia strains called ‘rough’ (R) did not cause illness in mice and another strain called ‘smooth’ caused illness in mice. When these two strains were injected separately in mice, they showed the expected results. Now, with this observation, Griffith wanted to find if the S strain can still infect after killing it with heat. \n\nIn his next set of experiments, he heat-killed the S strain and infected mice. It was found that heat-killed S strain could not cause illness in mice. He went one step further, used R strain and heat-killed S strain together to infect mice. This time the mice contracted pneumonia and died. Griffith concluded that even after heat killing there was still something present in the S strain that could ‘transform’ the live R strain and made it infectious. He named it the ‘transforming principle’. Griffith did not succeed in making a vaccine for pneumonia but provided valuable information to the understanding of genetic material. This was an exciting discovery.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1OJDAYvBt1K1_tIifbsbifSkfaW1ZVStz\">\n  <figcaption>Avery-MacLeod-McCarty Experiment</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nA few years later, in 1944, 3 scientists – Canadian-Americans Oswald Avery and Colin McLeod and American Maclyn McCarty wanted to find what Griffith’s ‘transforming principle’ was. They started with heat-killed S strain and slowly purified its components to isolate the ‘transforming principle’. When they isolated it, they could not identify it as protein but it passed the chemical tests for nucleic acid, specifically DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA). The isolated ‘transforming principle’ also had that same amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen as DNA. To confirm, they used enzymes that break proteins (protease) and RNA (RNase) but the ‘transforming principle’ could not be broken by those. However, a DNA digesting enzyme (DNase) broke the ‘transforming principle’ into small pieces and made it non-functional. This was confirmed by adding R pneumonia cells after the enzymes and observing if S illness-causing pneumonia cells appear. For protease and RNase, illness-causing pneumonia appeared, but after using DNase, they did not.\n\nThough these experiments supported that DNA was the ‘transforming principle’, Avery-McLeod-McCarty did not conclusively say that it was DNA as contamination could have occurred. They also likely did not want to go against all the scientists who thought proteins were involved in the genetic transfer. This is one of the instances where science might have been influenced by the then culture of scientific hypotheses. This is not uncommon in many other instances.\n\nSo, how did DNA get ‘confirmed’ as the genetic material? Who finally solved the structure of DNA?

The tiny self-copying units called DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) are present in all living cells on Earth. But how did we find out about them? What do they do? What do they look like?\n\nThe detailed process of understanding DNA took over 100 years. The discovery of DNA is a fascinating story and has many players like any other scientific discovery. As mentioned in Together We Science, discoveries do not happen out of the blue but step-by-step and a lot of great minds are involved. This story is long and thus, will be told in a few parts. \n\nHow is it that you can roll your tongue but your parents can’t? Or maybe the other way round. People from the same family have different characteristics. Or maybe someone has eyes like their grandmother but not like their parents. The reason for all of this can be found out through the study of Genetics. Now, let’s talk about the person who started it. This post will focus on an Austrian monk and his garden of peas.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1zY49BC4ZpioIY4MVSEkLFlwuBRK-3BCO\">\n  <figcaption>Gregor Johann Mendel</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nGregor Johann Mendel was born in 1822 in Austria. After looking at different prospects for a career and completing extensive education, Mendel, a monk, started teaching at a secondary school in the 1850s. In his garden, he noticed pea plants that had different characteristics. Plants were either tall or short, seed coats were brown or white, seeds were round or wrinkled, and so on. But these properties did not always appear together. Tall plants could have either brown or white seed coats; short plants could have either round or wrinkled seeds. These observations aroused curiosity in Mendel. If one of the parent plants was tall and the other was short, what would be the height of their children? Mendel designed experiments to test his theories. He took the first steps toward understanding genetics.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rGxEOcXoE1RK40anQ_OJK6eAVHOz406q\">\n  <figcaption>7 traits of peas in Mendelian Genetics</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nIn his experiments, Mendel controlled the pollination of the pea plants. This means he controlled that pollen (male sex cells)  from a specific plant went to a specific flower.  His treatments involved pollinating plants with opposite traits and examining their children. Mendel found that there are 7 characteristics or traits of the plants with 2 different possibilities or alleles each. One of the alleles is dominant and one of the alleles is recessive (these only show up if there is another of its kind). Each plant always has 2 alleles for one trait. This means a plant can have 2 of the same alleles (2 dominants or 2 recessives) or they could be mixed and matched where they have 1 dominant and 1 recessive allele. If a plant has 2 of the same alleles for a trait, it is called homozygous. If the alleles are mixed and matched, it is called heterozygous and the plant looks like the dominant trait. Mendel conducted several experiments to find out how these alleles or traits are passed down to the next generation.\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1i4D8kf_PTCKofC7GamF7NmOklmyUNtXM\">\n</figure>\n\n\nWith his experimental results, Mendel came up with 2 theories, called Mendel’s laws of inheritance.\n\nFirst, he found that for any trait, each parent’s pairing of alleles split, and one allele passes from each parent to a child.  Which particular allele in a pair gets passed on is completely up to chance. This is called the law of segregation. The ratio of the children with different traits in different generations showed which traits are dominant or recessive and how they are passed to the next generation.\n\nFor example, Mendel started with plants that had homozygous purple flowers and homozygous white flowers. This is called the parental (P) generation. When these plants were cross-pollinated, their next-generation had all purple flowers. This was called the first filial (F1) generation. Did the white flower allele disappear? Next, plants from the F1 generation were self-pollinated and white flowers reappeared in the 2nd Filial (F2) generation along with purple flower plants. The ratio of purple to white flower plants in the F2 generation was 3:1. This shows that the white allele was not lost in the F1 generation, it was just dominated by the purple allele. This means, even if the plant has purple flowers if it has a secret white flower allele, it can be passed on separately to the next generation. When making reproductive cells (gametes), the 2 alleles of a trait are always separated (segregated) and go to different children.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1wHIFCtaI4zJJyMWzCF4ka3Ww2DKScsXC\">\n  <figcaption>Law of segregation</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSecond, he found that different pairs of alleles are passed onto the children independently of each other. If a plant has both tall and short alleles and alleles for both purple and white flowers, it will appear tall with purple flowers. Their gametes can have different combinations of the alleles – tall and purple, tall and white, short and purple, or short and white. Therefore, the inheritance of genes at one location in a genome does not influence the inheritance of genes at another location. This is called the law of independent assortment. This law shows that dominant alleles of different traits are not always together but neither are recessive alleles, they can be mixed and matched in various ways while forming gametes.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1wHIFCtaI4zJJyMWzCF4ka3Ww2DKScsXC\">\n  <figcaption>Law of Independent Assortment</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nIf you can roll your tongue, chances are one or both your parents can roll theirs too as tongue-rolling is a dominant allele. If both your parents have blue eyes, you cannot have brown eyes. As blue eye color is a recessive allele, it can only be expressed when there are two of a kind. If you know the alleles of a couple, you can predict the chances of their kid having that allele. This works for predicting the probability of having genetic diseases as well.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ZiyqB8IFdOicIDIoe6eD1213G4jAdvHl\">\n  <figcaption>How is eye color allele passed on?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\nCan you find some other examples in yourself or people around you?\n\nMendel did not get everything right. Many things were unknown back then, there was no modern equipment.  But Mendel formed the basics of studying genetics. For his contributions to understanding the passing down of traits, Mendel is called the ‘Father of Genetics’. The results of Mendel’s experiments were not popular until 1901 when William Bateson translated Mendel’s work from German into English.\n\nMendel’s peas led to one of the first steps to understanding DNA and how it works. To understand Mendel’s laws better, start with Wikipedia and then check out the other sources at the end of this article.\n\nWhat happened next? Who isolated DNA? What experiments were done to find out more about DNA? What about its structure? Find out in the upcoming weeks.\n\n### FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nMendel, Gregor. 1866. Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden.

Have you heard the story of Issac Newton discovering gravity? Or, Edward Jenner inventing vaccination? Or August Kekulé dreaming of the structure of benzene?\n\nThese stories are exciting and inspiring. While these stories focus on one hero scientist who could solve all the problems by themselves, not all of them are true. This can be seen in current popular multimedia (movies/TV shows) as well, where contributions of many people are combined and one lead is presented whom the story follows. For example, in the HBO miniseries Chernobyl, the scientist was Valery Legasov who was helped by 1 or 2 other people. In reality, many scientists were involved in the cleanup efforts after the disaster who were not focused on maintaining dramatic effects.\n\nNow, let’s take a closer look at how the process of science is incorporated in the popular story of how Sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity. There’s no evidence of an apple actually falling on Newton’s head but let’s say it did. \n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1v8sUYfhEGaPL3DWg-_MqwIQ9xfY0Z2FS\">\n</figure>\n\nWhen we follow the process of science, first comes observation. Newton observed an apple fall off a tree. This led him to the question – why did the apple fall off the tree, and a hypothesis that there must be a force pulling the apple to the ground. His prediction was that if everything lands on the ground, there must be a force, which he named gravity (from Latin ‘gravitas’ meaning ‘having weight’) that pulls everything towards Earth. He did calculations and developed his theory of gravity. His calculations led to scientists performing experiments and many studies that showed gravitational force exists between every object in this universe. \n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1elWsMZ8NG6meb3dw7maV80klvnAIjtJB\">\n</figure>\n\n\nIt is an excellent story that tells you the power of thinking and discovery. There are many such great stories in science about the discovery and invention that often portrays the ideas of a ‘lone’ genius or ‘accidental’ discovery. Think about our beloved movie ‘Back to the Future’; Doc Brown was able to make a time machine all by himself, without any other scientist in the world knowing. This is unrealistic. What is left out of all these narratives is the collaborative nature of science. In reality, not one person knows everything; not all ideas come to scientists in dreams.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10NTy1aeCFfLAlF2lEWnWWkPaN5TZ_MBI\">\n</figure>\n\nContributions of other scientists that came before Newton played a role in the ideas Newton worked on. Newton’s theories were built upon work done by Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, and many others who came before him. That is not to say, he was not a genius, but he was not alone. He developed ideas that were already around and provided ideas for his peers and future physicists like Albert Einstein. His work does not exist in isolation.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1grv12bdwH7H-zzGIfhFhY6uTk-XL2lWT\">\n</figure>\n\n\nTo get an idea, find any scientific paper on Google Scholar. It can be something random or your subject of interest. First, check out the authors in the beginning. Then, scroll to the last couple of pages of the full paper to the ‘References’ section and scan how many papers are cited. This will give you an idea of how many scientists’ work was followed or used as a reference to do the research for just that paper. It will also help you understand that you do not need to reinvent the wheel whenever you start researching a topic. There have been some, if not a lot, research done in your interest, find it, and build on it.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=13msmUWIyGQpQyB3PPBiccmyknS1_EOiW\">\n</figure>\n\n\nScientists not only belong to research universities but they come from industries, government organizations as well as non-government organizations. Once it is realized how collaborative science is, it’s easier to understand why it might seem like science is always changing when faced with new observations. Often, the initial explanations we hear are the 1st hypotheses that some scientists have, but with experimentation and data analysis, that hypothesis might not be supported and then you hear their alternative explanation or alternate hypothesis. There is always emerging knowledge because of how diverse we are as human beings with diverse perspectives.\n\nWe need to truly cherish the collaborative nature of science along with the fascinating stories and make science a part of our everyday life and not something beyond it.\n\n### FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nIsaac Newton: The man who discovered gravity \nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/isaac-newton-the-man-who-discovered-gravity/zh8792p\nEdward Jenner https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200696/\nAugust Kekulé https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Kekul%C3%A9#Benzene\nMeaning of serendipity: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/serendipitous\nChernobyl, HBO miniseries. https://www.hbo.com/chernobyl \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)\nChernobyl: 7 People Who Played a Crucial Role in the World’s Worst Nuclear Disaster\nhttps://www.history.com/news/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-7-people-who-played-crucial-role\nNewton, I. 1687.

Why?\n\nWhen I was 11, I thought of 5 options that I could ‘be’ – a detective, a doctor, a dancer, a scientist or an astronaut. As I grew older, the only option that remained was being a doctor as that was a family expectation. However, in the deepest of my desires, I did not want that for myself. I wanted to explore and not have specific responsibilities in someone’s life. Of course, that seems a little escapist now but I wanted to explore the world and explore the life in it. That will be a future talking point.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=16SmjyGLIrvfy_yluwillIgic1RStbJgr\">\n</figure>\n\n\nNow, why should anyone want to become a scientist when a lot of other jobs pay so much better? The first important question to ask yourself is, ‘what gives me joy?’ If the answer is related to not having work hours set by someone else, applying creativity in your work, and thinking about the world around you, ask yourself the next three questions to check.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1dsgJ3Q3_L3WCHFAwJt41hwGOgJY8N0vZ\">\n</figure>\n\n\n1. Do you want to find out how things work? I always feel great when I can figure out how a magician did their trick. Science lets you look behind the curtain. Oh, the fly is just always a fraction of a second faster than me. How?\n2. Do you want to find out why things are the way they are? The apple always falls on the ground. Why?\n3. Do you enjoy meeting new people? Being a scientist, you can travel to different places and meet new people.\n\nIt is a common misconception that all scientists live in laboratories with colorful liquids. \nThe third one is the most important factor in my decision. Depending on what kind of scientist you are, you may never have to see the inside of a lab. Apart from working on your research, you can go to different conferences and meet people from all around the world. Also, if you are interested in science communication, you not only meet other scientists from your field but everyone.\n\nThere is likely a myriad of other reasons to become a scientist. For me, it was the chance to be able to solve even one of the world’s ‘mysteries’. And you can do it all by following the [process of science](https://rainbowsandbrains.com/how-does-science-happen/).\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1utZyG_KbZR8ExkNIwWlbd33LYP-mzj8o\">\n</figure>\n\n\nIt is important to remember that science is not a ‘lone’ endeavor. Charles Singer, a historian of science, said that [‘Science is knowledge in the making’](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2415517/). This knowledge does not come suddenly all at once or from one mind. There are rigorous methods and precautions that scientists take to derive results to support their hypothesis. However, scientists are often wrong. The beauty of science is that you can try again and find the right answer. Most importantly, you can work with other scientists.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=18EfKHrL3yGVN8FKLgx7E-lFj5RbK090d\">\n</figure>\n\n\nThe pursuit of knowledge and truth that scientists embark on is not always easy; it is enthralled with emotions. The joy of supporting your hypothesis, the crippling anxiety of not making progress, the heartbreak of an experiment failing, and the thrill of finding a new way and succeeding; all comes with being a scientist. And everything goes back to the process of science. If you have to reject your hypothesis, that is not the end; you just find an alternate explanation and continue.\n\nThe victory of adding a tiny part of information to the vast repository of science makes being a scientist and everything that comes along worth it.\n\n### FOR MORE INFORMATION:\nSinger, C. 1921.

Or kept a plant alive on your window sill? Chances are, you used the scientific method.\n\nWhen was the last time you thought about science? There will be a wide range of answers. As a scientist in the making, the answer for me will be now writing this article. If I was watching a movie, I might not focus on it. But every equipment/technique that goes into the procedure of making a movie, does require science.\n\nOften, doing science does not have to be very active. It might be just problem solving, pranking your best friend, or finding a way to make caramel. You are probably engaging in science without knowing it. For example, when you switched on a light and the bulb did not turn on, you must have asked yourself why. This led you to an answer like the bulb is worn out and you acted upon it, solving the situation. This includes the scientific method or process of science.\n\nNow, what is it?\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1-noN-OFSgkqkRipyewRH-XS-j7zGJ5sx\" alt=\"6 steps of science: Observation, Question, Hypothesis, Prediction, Experiment, and Results\">\n</figure>\n\n\nIt generally involves 6 steps – Observation, Question, Hypothesis (an explanation), Prediction (how we might be able to show our explanation is correct), Experiment (testing a hypothesis), and Results. At the end of the process, with supportive results, one can accept the hypothesis. That is how science is done. The man who laid out the Scientific Method is [Roger Bacon (~1214-1292)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2178622?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents).\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Vp_bdJmGjfnqSK2zMDoL_uKpDqqb2wj9\">\n</figure>\n\n\nWith each step, there is some level of thought involved. You probably observe thousands of details throughout a day. Unless you find it out of the ordinary or your curious bone tickled, you might not come up with a question. You will get to a hypothesis as you try to find a possible answer to your question and a prediction when you think about how to test it. It is important to recognize that a hypothesis has to be testable and falsifiable.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1NhmijMmdIZt4k1G_WN1SC2L6JSWRyBdR\">\n</figure>\n\nWhat this means is, you can hypothesize that there might be other planets out there that have life, like on Earth after observing millions of stars in the night sky. However, it is not a testable or falsifiable hypothesis as you cannot actually go look at most other planets at the moment, i.e. cannot perform an experiment. The results of the experiment tell us if your hypothesis is supported or not. And analyzing the results to come up with a conclusion might be a challenge sometimes.\n\nNevertheless, you do not need a degree to use the scientific method. It is likely that you already use it for various tasks in your everyday life.\n\nLet’s take an everyday life example.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1R-SQuj-QG1BQY5DajXOA9S2GQVzjk3vh\">\n</figure>\n\n\nObservation: Your car won’t start.\n\nQuestion: Why won’t the car start?\n\nHypothesis: There is no gas in the car.\n\nPrediction: If you put in more gas, the car will start.\n\nExperiment: You went to the gas station, got more gas in a container and filled up the gas tank.\n\nResults: The car still won’t start.\n\nAlternate hypothesis: The car battery is dead.\n\nNow, here is an important concept to understand about the scientific method. A hypothesis is an educated guess from previous background knowledge. But your first guess is likely not to be the correct explanation for your question. After experimentation, when you figure that out, there is no shame in rejecting your hypothesis and forming an alternate hypothesis. Sometimes, it might require focusing and thinking hard to come up with a different explanation. And for scientists, this whole process could be repeated countless times before they find the right answer and can show it. Often, scientists do not do it just by themselves. More on that later.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1LTlKmdAhfSpk0uLi119Y2ZXxRZuxF_1X\">\n</figure>\n\n\n\nSo, the next time you are faced with a situation, say your washing machine does not work or your garden is full of flowers that you did not plant, think about the process of science. Remember, you do not have to succeed and resolve the situation on your first try or alone, there is always an alternate hypothesis and many other minds to join forces with.\n\nHere’s to Science, the incessant pursuit of truth and knowledge!\n\n### FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nThorndike, L. 1914.

Or something that only people who are really lucky can see.\n\nOne day when I was 12, on my way back from school on the school bus, I, suddenly, heard other students sitting behind me shout and run to the back window. When I made out what they were saying, I realized one of them saw a rainbow. I looked out of my nearest window and all I could see were buildings. I tried to go to the back window of the bus but there was already a crowd. After a minute or so, everyone went back to their seats. I felt this hollow that I missed it and I might never have a chance to see another rainbow ever again.\n\nThe first rainbow that I ever remember seeing was right outside my undergrad college. This college was situated 2 or so kilometers outside my birth city. In the first month of college, on a rainy day, with my new friends, I saw it, a rainbow. Looking back, it was a defining moment. From my introverted school days, I became at least an ambivert college kid who talked to a lot of people, exchanged ideas, held leadership positions, and went for what she wanted. Nothing was impossible. Nothing was unseeable. Nothing was unobservable anymore.\n\nThe feeling of freedom means a lot to me. I have felt constrained in lots of ways growing up, so when in college, I was not seen as just a geek who could not speak in public, I spoke my mind left and right but in the back of the head, I still felt imposter syndrome. I still do. One of the bigger questions is why will anyone be interested in what I have to say. Maybe I am just forcing my thoughts out to the world.\n\nI have always been a voracious reader. In high school, social media posts were added to my reading list. Slowly, I felt my world broaden and include things even if I didn’t know they existed. For a while, I was quick to believe everything, but then I learned to filter through the untrue to get to the true stuff. I am still not sure about my success rate though.\n\nIn this process, I learned about this whole world of meaning attached to rainbows. I became an ally. \n\nWhen it came to naming my blog, which is going to be unlike my juvenile dabbles with blogging, I wanted to mean something close to me. I am a scientist or at least on the way to officially be one. I like philosophical discussions. I love reading. I draw and dabble in other forms of art like crafts, dance, and even trying to play a musical instrument. I wanted my blog to be all-inclusive. Everything that concocted in a brain. I want to communicate science along with philosophy and art. I want to put my thoughts out in the universe. And that’s what this blog is for.\n\nWelcome to RainbowsandBrains!","slug":"what-is-rainbowsandbrains","title_img":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1PwOdwJ6fON-o8RxSXv9ZcL7qYzHmQ-Zv","description":"In this article, I will describe the origin story of my blog 'Rainbows and Brains'"}]
