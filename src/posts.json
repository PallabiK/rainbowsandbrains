[{"id":1601096400,"title":"Why Become a SCIENTIST?","author":"PK","date":"September 26, 2020","content":"\n\nAs a child, I was often asked, ‘What do you want to become when you grow up?’ This was a reality check for me, realizing what you HAVE to be something when you grow up. Why?\n\nWhen I was 11, I thought of 5 options that I could ‘be’ – a detective, a doctor, a dancer, a scientist or an astronaut. As I grew older, the only option that remained was being a doctor as that was a family expectation. However, in the deepest of my desires, I did not want that for myself. I wanted to explore and not have specific responsibilities in someone’s life. Of course, that seems a little escapist now but I wanted to explore the world and explore the life in it. That will be a future talking point.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=16SmjyGLIrvfy_yluwillIgic1RStbJgr\">\n</figure>\n\n\nNow, why should anyone want to become a scientist when a lot of other jobs pay so much better? The first important question to ask yourself is, ‘what gives me joy?’ If the answer is related to not having work hours set by someone else, applying creativity in your work, and thinking about the world around you, ask yourself the next three questions to check.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1dsgJ3Q3_L3WCHFAwJt41hwGOgJY8N0vZ\">\n</figure>\n\n\n1. Do you want to find out how things work? I always feel great when I can figure out how a magician did their trick. Science lets you look behind the curtain. Oh, the fly is just always a fraction of a second faster than me. How?\n2. Do you want to find out why things are the way they are? The apple always falls on the ground. Why?\n3. Do you enjoy meeting new people? Being a scientist, you can travel to different places and meet new people.\n\nIt is a common misconception that all scientists live in laboratories with colorful liquids. \nThe third one is the most important factor in my decision. Depending on what kind of scientist you are, you may never have to see the inside of a lab. Apart from working on your research, you can go to different conferences and meet people from all around the world. Also, if you are interested in science communication, you not only meet other scientists from your field but everyone.\n\nThere is likely a myriad of other reasons to become a scientist. For me, it was the chance to be able to solve even one of the world’s ‘mysteries’. And you can do it all by following the [process of science](https://rainbowsandbrains.com/how-does-science-happen/).\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1utZyG_KbZR8ExkNIwWlbd33LYP-mzj8o\">\n</figure>\n\n\nIt is important to remember that science is not a ‘lone’ endeavor. Charles Singer, a historian of science, said that [‘Science is knowledge in the making’](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2415517/). This knowledge does not come suddenly all at once or from one mind. There are rigorous methods and precautions that scientists take to derive results to support their hypothesis. However, scientists are often wrong. The beauty of science is that you can try again and find the right answer. Most importantly, you can work with other scientists.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=18EfKHrL3yGVN8FKLgx7E-lFj5RbK090d\">\n</figure>\n\n\nThe pursuit of knowledge and truth that scientists embark on is not always easy; it is enthralled with emotions. The joy of supporting your hypothesis, the crippling anxiety of not making progress, the heartbreak of an experiment failing, and the thrill of finding a new way and succeeding; all comes with being a scientist. And everything goes back to the process of science. If you have to reject your hypothesis, that is not the end; you just find an alternate explanation and continue.\n\nThe victory of adding a tiny part of information to the vast repository of science makes being a scientist and everything that comes along worth it.\n\n### FOR MORE INFORMATION:\nSinger, C. 1921.

Or kept a plant alive on your window sill? Chances are, you used the scientific method.\n\nWhen was the last time you thought about science? There will be a wide range of answers. As a scientist in the making, the answer for me will be now writing this article. If I was watching a movie, I might not focus on it. But every equipment/technique that goes into the procedure of making a movie, does require science.\n\nOften, doing science does not have to be very active. It might be just problem solving, pranking your best friend, or finding a way to make caramel. You are probably engaging in science without knowing it. For example, when you switched on a light and the bulb did not turn on, you must have asked yourself why. This led you to an answer like the bulb is worn out and you acted upon it, solving the situation. This includes the scientific method or process of science.\n\nNow, what is it?\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1-noN-OFSgkqkRipyewRH-XS-j7zGJ5sx\" alt=\"6 steps of science: Observation, Question, Hypothesis, Prediction, Experiment, and Results\">\n</figure>\n\n\nIt generally involves 6 steps – Observation, Question, Hypothesis (an explanation), Prediction (how we might be able to show our explanation is correct), Experiment (testing a hypothesis), and Results. At the end of the process, with supportive results, one can accept the hypothesis. That is how science is done. The man who laid out the Scientific Method is [Roger Bacon (~1214-1292)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2178622?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents).\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Vp_bdJmGjfnqSK2zMDoL_uKpDqqb2wj9\">\n</figure>\n\n\nWith each step, there is some level of thought involved. You probably observe thousands of details throughout a day. Unless you find it out of the ordinary or your curious bone tickled, you might not come up with a question. You will get to a hypothesis as you try to find a possible answer to your question and a prediction when you think about how to test it. It is important to recognize that a hypothesis has to be testable and falsifiable.\n\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1NhmijMmdIZt4k1G_WN1SC2L6JSWRyBdR\">\n</figure>\n\nWhat this means is, you can hypothesize that there might be other planets out there that have life, like on Earth after observing millions of stars in the night sky. However, it is not a testable or falsifiable hypothesis as you cannot actually go look at most other planets at the moment, i.e. cannot perform an experiment. The results of the experiment tell us if your hypothesis is supported or not. And analyzing the results to come up with a conclusion might be a challenge sometimes.\n\nNevertheless, you do not need a degree to use the scientific method. It is likely that you already use it for various tasks in your everyday life.\n\nLet’s take an everyday life example.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1R-SQuj-QG1BQY5DajXOA9S2GQVzjk3vh\">\n</figure>\n\n\nObservation: Your car won’t start.\n\nQuestion: Why won’t the car start?\n\nHypothesis: There is no gas in the car.\n\nPrediction: If you put in more gas, the car will start.\n\nExperiment: You went to the gas station, got more gas in a container and filled up the gas tank.\n\nResults: The car still won’t start.\n\nAlternate hypothesis: The car battery is dead.\n\nNow, here is an important concept to understand about the scientific method. A hypothesis is an educated guess from previous background knowledge. But your first guess is likely not to be the correct explanation for your question. After experimentation, when you figure that out, there is no shame in rejecting your hypothesis and forming an alternate hypothesis. Sometimes, it might require focusing and thinking hard to come up with a different explanation. And for scientists, this whole process could be repeated countless times before they find the right answer and can show it. Often, scientists do not do it just by themselves. More on that later.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 300px;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1LTlKmdAhfSpk0uLi119Y2ZXxRZuxF_1X\">\n</figure>\n\n\n\nSo, the next time you are faced with a situation, say your washing machine does not work or your garden is full of flowers that you did not plant, think about the process of science. Remember, you do not have to succeed and resolve the situation on your first try or alone, there is always an alternate hypothesis and many other minds to join forces with.\n\nHere’s to Science, the incessant pursuit of truth and knowledge!\n\n### FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nThorndike, L. 1914.

Or something that only people who are really lucky can see.\n\nOne day when I was 12, on my way back from school on the school bus, I, suddenly, heard other students sitting behind me shout and run to the back window. When I made out what they were saying, I realized one of them saw a rainbow. I looked out of my nearest window and all I could see were buildings. I tried to go to the back window of the bus but there was already a crowd. After a minute or so, everyone went back to their seats. I felt this hollow that I missed it and I might never have a chance to see another rainbow ever again.\n\nThe first rainbow that I ever remember seeing was right outside my undergrad college. This college was situated 2 or so kilometers outside my birth city. In the first month of college, on a rainy day, with my new friends, I saw it, a rainbow. Looking back, it was a defining moment. From my introverted school days, I became at least an ambivert college kid who talked to a lot of people, exchanged ideas, held leadership positions, and went for what she wanted. Nothing was impossible. Nothing was unseeable. Nothing was unobservable anymore.\n\nThe feeling of freedom means a lot to me. I have felt constrained in lots of ways growing up, so when in college, I was not seen as just a geek who could not speak in public, I spoke my mind left and right but in the back of the head, I still felt imposter syndrome. I still do. One of the bigger questions is why will anyone be interested in what I have to say. Maybe I am just forcing my thoughts out to the world.\n\nI have always been a voracious reader. In high school, social media posts were added to my reading list. Slowly, I felt my world broaden and include things even if I didn’t know they existed. For a while, I was quick to believe everything, but then I learned to filter through the untrue to get to the true stuff. I am still not sure about my success rate though.\n\nIn this process, I learned about this whole world of meaning attached to rainbows. I became an ally. \n\nWhen it came to naming my blog, which is going to be unlike my juvenile dabbles with blogging, I wanted to mean something close to me. I am a scientist or at least on the way to officially be one. I like philosophical discussions. I love reading. I draw and dabble in other forms of art like crafts, dance, and even trying to play a musical instrument. I wanted my blog to be all-inclusive. Everything that concocted in a brain. I want to communicate science along with philosophy and art. I want to put my thoughts out in the universe. And that’s what this blog is for.\n\nWelcome to RainbowsandBrains!","slug":"what-is-rainbowsandbrains","title_img":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1PwOdwJ6fON-o8RxSXv9ZcL7qYzHmQ-Zv","description":"In this article, I will describe the origin story of my blog 'Rainbows and Brains'"}]
